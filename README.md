# RoboJosh-WhatsApp-Bot-AI

This project involves creating a simple WhatsApp bot using Node.js and the Baileys library, integrated with the OpenAI API to deliver intelligent message responses. The Baileys library facilitates seamless interaction with WhatsApp, allowing the bot to send and receive messages efficiently. By harnessing the power of OpenAI's language models, the bot can generate contextually relevant and intelligent replies to user messages, making it a powerful tool for automating WhatsApp conversations. The project is designed for ease of setup and deployment, with clear instructions provided for installing and configuring the necessary dependencies. This combination of technologies offers an effective and efficient solution for those looking to implement an AI-driven chatbot on the WhatsApp platform.
